 Milk-Adulteration-Detector
This project is to ensure the quality of the milk efficiently.

PROJECT OVERVIEW

  Milk adulteration is a serious public health and economic problem, especially in rural and unregulated markets. Harmful substances such as water, urea, starch, detergent, salt, and synthetic milk are commonly mixed into milk to increase volume and profit, which degrades quality and may cause serious health issues.

This project proposes a portable, low-cost, IoT-based milk adulteration detection system using:

- AS7262 Multispectral Sensor
- EC (Electrical Conductivity) Sensor
- pH Sensor
- ESP32 microcontroller
- Mobile App (Bluetooth / Wi-Fi)

The system provides real-time milk quality analysis without requiring expensive laboratory equipment.

OBJECTIVES

To develop a portable real-time milk adulteration detection device

To detect multiple adulterants such as:

- Water
- Starch
- Urea
- Detergent
- Salt
- Synthetic milk

To use multispectral sensing + electrical conductivity for higher reliability. To apply machine learning (Logistic Regression) for intelligent classification. To display results on a mobile application instantly
